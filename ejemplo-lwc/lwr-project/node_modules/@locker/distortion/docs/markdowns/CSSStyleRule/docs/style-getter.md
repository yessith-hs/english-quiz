## CSSStyleRule.prototype.style getter

The [`CSSStyleRule.prototype.style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleRule/style) read-only property is the `CSSStyleDeclaration` interface for the declaration block of the `CSSStyleRule`.

The `style` property of a `CSSStyleRule` object lets you manipulate CSS styles with JavaScript by using  assignments. For example, you could change a style sheet rule's text color using `document.styleSheets[0].cssRules[0].style.color = 'red'`.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion alters the getter of the `style` property for any `CSSStyleRule`. The `style` object is marked as live so that its native behavior is preserved and any properties changed from within the sandbox are also reflected in the DOM.
