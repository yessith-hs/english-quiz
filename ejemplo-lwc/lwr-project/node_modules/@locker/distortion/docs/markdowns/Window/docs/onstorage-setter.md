## WindowEventHandlers.onstorage

The [`onstorage`]https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onstorage) property of the `WindowEventHandlers` mixin is an event handler for processing storage events.

The `storage` event fires when a storage area has been changed in the context of another document.

### Distorted Behavior

Currently, Lightning Web Security doesn't support the `window.onstorage` event, so setting the `onstorage` property is not allowed and returns an error.
