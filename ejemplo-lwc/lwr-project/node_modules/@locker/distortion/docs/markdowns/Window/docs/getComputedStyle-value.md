## Window.prototype.getComputedStyle

The [`Window.prototype.getComputedStyle()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle) method returns an object containing the values of all CSS properties of an element, after applying active style sheets and resolving any basic computation those values may contain.

The returned object is the same `CSSStyleDeclaration` type as the object returned from the element's `style` property. However, the two objects have different purposes:
  - The object returned by `getComputedStyle` is read-only, and should be used to inspect the element's style â€” including those set by a `<style>` element or an external stylesheet.
  - The `element.style` object should be used to set styles on that element, or inspect styles directly added to it from JavaScript manipulation or the global `style` attribute.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion alters the returned style object. The style object is marked as live so that its native behavior is preserved and any attempt to mutate its read-only CSS properties results in the expected DOM exception.
