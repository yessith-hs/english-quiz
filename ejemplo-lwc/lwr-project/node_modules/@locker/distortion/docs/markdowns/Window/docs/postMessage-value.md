## Window.prototype.postMessage

The [`Window.prototype.postMessage()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) method safely enables cross-origin communication between `Window` objects; e.g., between a page and a pop-up that it spawned, or between a page and an iframe embedded within it.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion preserves the `postMessage()` method's native behavior in the sandbox by ensuring that the [structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm) works correctly on the `message` parameter.
