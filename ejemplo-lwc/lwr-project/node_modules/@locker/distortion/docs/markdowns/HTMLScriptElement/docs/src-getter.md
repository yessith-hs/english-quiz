## HTMLScriptElement.prototype.src getter

[`HTMLScriptElement.prototype.src`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLScriptElement) property is a `DOMString` representing the URL of an external script. It reflects the `src` attribute of the `<script>` element specifying the URL to an external script.

Lightning Web Security sets the original url to a different attribute named `data-distorted-src`, while the `src` attribute points to a distorted value that's not revealed in the sandbox.

Lightning Web Security's distortion for the `src` getter obtains the original value from `data-distorted-src`.

In some scenarios, a `<script>` element is already present in the DOM, inserted by the system through some other mechanisms. In these cases, LWS accesses the original `src` attribute.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion returns the value of `data-distorted-src` when code in the sandbox tries to access `src` attribute on a `<script>` element.
