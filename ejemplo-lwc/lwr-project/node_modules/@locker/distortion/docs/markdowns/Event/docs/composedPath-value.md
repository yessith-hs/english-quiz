## Event.prototype.composedPath

The [`Event.prototype.composedPath()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/composedPath) method returns the event's path which is an array of objects on which listeners will be invoked. This does not include nodes in shadow trees if the shadow root was created with its `ShadowRoot.mode` closed.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion returns an array of the objects on which listeners will be invoked, up to the closed custom element itself. The array doesn't include the shadow root, or nodes inside the shadow root.
