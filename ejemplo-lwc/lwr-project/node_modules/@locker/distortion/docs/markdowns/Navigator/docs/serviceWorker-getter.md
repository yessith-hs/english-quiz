## Navigator.prototype.serviceWorker getter

The [`Navigator`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator) interface represents the state and the identity of the user agent. It allows scripts to query it and to register themselves to carry on some activities.

The [`Navigator.prototype.serviceWorker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/serviceWorker) read-only property returns the `ServiceWorkerContainer` object for the associated document, which provides access to registration, removal, upgrade, and communication with the `ServiceWorker`.

With access to the `serviceWorker` property, malicious code can alter the response of a request to return JavaScript code that's not in a sandbox when evaluated by the browser.

For example:
```js
navigator.serviceWorker.register('/static/sw.js').then(() => {
    window.open('/static/aaa', '_self');
});
```

```js
//  file /static/sw.js
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
    const unsandboxed = '<body><script>document.body.innerHTML=document.cookie;</script>';
    event.respondWith(new Response(unsandboxed, { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' } }));
});
```

To prevent JavaScript code from leaking data outside the sandbox, Lightning Web Security disallows access to the `navigator.serviceWorker` property.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion returns `undefined` when code accesses the `navigator.serviceWorker` property.
