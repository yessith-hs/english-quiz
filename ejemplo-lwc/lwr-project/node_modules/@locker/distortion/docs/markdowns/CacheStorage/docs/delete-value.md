## CacheStorage.prototype.delete

The [`CacheStorage.prototype.delete()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage/delete) method of the `CacheStorage` interface finds the `Cache` object matching the `cacheName`, and if found, deletes the `Cache` object and returns a `Promise` that resolves to `true`. If no `Cache` object is found, it resolves to `false`.

If malicious code can access any cache object on a page, it can arbitrarily replace or remove cache objects. This behavior can have catastrophic effects in a multi-tenant environment like Salesforce.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion prevents deletion of cache objects outside the sandbox. Cache objects in the sandbox are protected from code outside or in other sandboxes.

The `delete()` method is restricted to cache objects created by the requesting sandbox.
