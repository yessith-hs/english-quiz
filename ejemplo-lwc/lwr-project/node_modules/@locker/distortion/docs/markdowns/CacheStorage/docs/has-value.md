## CacheStorage.prototype.has

The [`CacheStorage.prototype.has()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage/has) method of the `CacheStorage` interface returns a `Promise` that resolves to `true` if a `Cache` object matches the `cacheName`.

If malicious code can detect any cache object on a page, it can potentially modify cache objects. This behavior can have catastrophic effects in a multi-tenant environment like Salesforce.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion prevents detection of cache objects outside the sandbox. Cache objects in the sandbox are protected from code outside or in other sandboxes.

The `has()` method is restricted to cache objects created by the requesting sandbox.
