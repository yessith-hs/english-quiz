## CacheStorage.prototype.match

The [`CacheStorage.prototype.match()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage/match) method of the `CacheStorage` interface checks if a given `Request` or url string is a key for a stored `Response`. This method returns a `Promise` for a `Response`, or a `Promise` which resolves to `undefined` if no match is found.

If malicious code can access any cache object on a page, it can arbitrarily replace or remove cache objects. This behavior can have catastrophic effects in a multi-tenant environment like Salesforce.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion requires `caches.match()` calls to include the second `options` argument and provide an explicit `cacheName` property value.

The `match()` method rejects the promise if `options` is omitted, or if the `cacheName` property of `options` is omitted.
