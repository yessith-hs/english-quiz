## CacheStorage.prototype.keys

The [`CacheStorage.prototype.keys()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage/keys) method of the `CacheStorage` interface returns a `Promise` that will resolve with an array containing strings corresponding to all of the named `Cache` objects tracked by the `CacheStorage` object in the order they were created. Use this method to iterate over a list of all `Cache` objects.

If malicious code can access any cache object on a page, it can arbitrarily replace or remove cache objects. This behavior can have catastrophic effects in a multi-tenant environment like Salesforce.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion prevents access to cache objects outside the sandbox. Cache objects in the sandbox are protected from code outside or in other sandboxes.

The `keys()` method is restricted to cache objects created by the requesting sandbox.
