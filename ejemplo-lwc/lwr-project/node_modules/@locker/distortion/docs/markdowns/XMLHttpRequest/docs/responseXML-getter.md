## XMLHttpRequest.prototype.responseXML getter

The [`XMLHttpRequest.prototype.responseXML`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/responseXML) read-only property returns a `Document` containing the HTML or XML retrieved by the request. It returns `null` if the request was unsuccessful, hasn't yet been sent, or if the data can't be parsed as XML or HTML.

Malicious code can add `<script>` tags that run without being sanitized.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion sanitizes the `responseXML` property value.
