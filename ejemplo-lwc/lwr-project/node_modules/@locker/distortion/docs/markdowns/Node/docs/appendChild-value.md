## Node.prototype.appendChild

The [`Node.prototype.appendChild()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild) method adds a node to the end of the list of children of a specified parent node. If the given child is a reference to an existing node in the document, `appendChild()` moves it from its current position to the new position (there is no requirement to remove the node from its parent node before appending it to some other node).

Lightning Web Security runs in the main window, where the `<html>` and `<head>` elements are shared. Malicious code can append a child element directly to those shared elements, corrupting the DOM of the current rendered page.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion allows only a `<script>` or `<link>` element to be appended as a child to `<html>` and `<head>` elements. It throws an exception if any other element is specified.
