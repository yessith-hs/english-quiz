## Range.prototype.*

The `Range` interface represents a fragment of a document that can contain nodes and parts of text nodes.

- The [`Range.prototype.setEnd()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Range/setEnd) method sets the end position of a `Range` to be located at the given offset into the specified node x. Setting the end point above (higher in the document) than the start point will result in a collapsed range with the start and end points both set to the specified end position.
- The [`Range.prototype.selectNode()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Range/selectNode) method sets the `Range` to contain the `Node` and its contents. The parent `Node` of the start and end of the `Range` will be the same as the parent of the `referenceNode`.
- The [`Range.prototype.selectNodeContents()`]() method sets the `Range` to contain the contents of a `Node`.
- The [`Range.prototype.setEndAfter()`]() method sets the end position of a `Range` relative to another `Node`. The parent `Node` of end of the `Range` will be the same as that for the `referenceNode`.
- The [`Range.prototype.setEndBefore()`]() method sets the end position of a `Range` relative to another `Node`. The parent `Node` of end of the `Range` will be the same as that for the `referenceNode`.
- The [`Range.prototype.setStart()`]() method sets the start position of a `Range`.
- The [`Range.prototype.setStartAfter()`]() method sets the start position of a `Range` relative to a `Node`. The parent `Node` of the start of the `Range` will be the same as that for the `referenceNode`.
- The [`Range.prototype.setStartBefore()`]() method sets the start position of a `Range` relative to another `Node`. The parent `Node` of the start of the `Range` will be the same as that for the `referenceNode`.
- The [`Range.prototype.surroundContents()`]() method moves content of the `Range` into a new node, placing the new node at the start of the specified range.

Lightning Web Security runs in the main window, where the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements are shared. These methods would allow a shared element to be included in a range, which would in turn allow malicious code to access shared elements. LWS prevents these methods from including shared elements in a range.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion prevents `setEnd()`, `selectNode()`, `selectNodeContents()`, `setEndAfter()`, `setEndBefore()`, `setStart()`, `setStartAfter()`, `setStartBefore()`, and `surroundContents()` from including any shared elements in a range.
