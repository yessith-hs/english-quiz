## SVGAnimateElement: `from` attribute

The [`from`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/From) attribute indicates the initial value of the attribute that will be modified during the animation.

When used with the `to` attribute, the animation will change the modified attribute from the `from` value to the `to` value. When used with the `by` attribute, the animation will change the attribute relatively from the `from` value by the value specified in `by`.

When you set the SVG resource dynamically with the `from` attribute, the SVG resource isn't sanitized. Malicious code can bypass Lightning Web Security with an `<iframe>` or `<script>` element inside the SVG resource and  run code outside the sandbox. 

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion sanitizes SVG files that are passed with the `from` attribute of the `<animate>` element.
