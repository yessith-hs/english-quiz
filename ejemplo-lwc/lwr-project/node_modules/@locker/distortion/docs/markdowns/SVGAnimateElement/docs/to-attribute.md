## SVGAnimateElement: `to` attribute

The [`to`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/To) attribute indicates the final value of the attribute that will be modified during the animation.

The value of the attribute will change between the `from` attribute value and this value.

When you set the SVG resource dynamically with the `to` attribute, the SVG resource isn't sanitized. Malicious code can bypass Lightning Web Security with an `<iframe>` or `<script>` element inside the SVG resource and run code outside the sandbox. 

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion sanitizes SVG files that are passed with the `to` attribute of the `<animate>` element.
