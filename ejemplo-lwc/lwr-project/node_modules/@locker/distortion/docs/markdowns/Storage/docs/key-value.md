## Storage.prototype.key

The [`Storage.prototype.key()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/key) method, when passed a number n, returns the name of the nth key in a given `Storage` object. The order of keys is user-agent defined, so you can't rely on it. Therefore, itâ€™s OK to have the storage items out of order.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion retrieves a key value at a specific index from the sandboxed code's synthetic storage.
