## Document.prototype.open

The [`document.open()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/open) method opens a document for writing.

The `document.open()` method normally takes no arguments. However, there is a lesser-known variation: if you pass three arguments, `document.open()` acts as an alias for `window.open()`. This new window context is not sandboxed properly and malicious code can access system mode, so Lightning Web Security must apply a distortion to prevent such access.

### Distorted Behavior

When `document.open()` is invoked with three arguments, the distortion returns an artificial `window` object that contains safe methods.
