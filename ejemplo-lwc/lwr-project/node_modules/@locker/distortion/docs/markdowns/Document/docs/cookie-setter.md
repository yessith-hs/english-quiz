## Document.prototype.cookie setter

The [`Document.cookie`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/cookie) property lets you read and write cookies associated with the document. It serves as a getter and setter for the actual values of the cookies.

The setter for `Document.prototype.cookie` is distorted so the getter can retrieve sandbox cookies. Additionally, the distortion prevents changes to critical system cookies that are necessary for Salesforce to function properly. If code in a sandbox is allowed to set system cookies, it can send malicious payloads to the backend using cookies.

### Distorted Behavior

The setter can modify only cookies that belong to the sandbox.
