## SharedWorker Constructor

The [`SharedWorker()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker/SharedWorker) constructor creates a `SharedWorker` object that executes the script at the specified URL. This script must obey the same-origin policy, a security mechanism that restricts how a document or script loaded by one origin can interact with a resource from another origin.

Malicious code can use `SharedWorker()` to execute script at a specified URL to bypass Lightning Web Security distortions.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion throws an exception when calling the constructor, and blocks access to `SharedWorker.prototype`.
