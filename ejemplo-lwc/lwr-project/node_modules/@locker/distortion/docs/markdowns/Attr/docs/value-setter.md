## Attr.prototype.value setter

The [`Attr`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attr/value) interface represents one of an element's attributes as an object.

The core idea of an object of type `Attr` is the association between a name and a value. An attribute may also be part of a namespace and, in this case, it also has a URI identifying the namespace, and a prefix that is an abbreviation for the namespace.

This distortion acts as a router for attribute distortions. It checks a registry for distortions that apply to a particular attribute name and invokes those distortions.

This distortion works only on connected attribute nodes. Disconnected nodes are covered by `setAttributeNode` and `setAttributeNodeNS` distortions.

This example of setting the value of `rel` property of a link shows behavior that's blocked.

```js
const attr = createAttribute('rel');
const el = createElement('link');
el.setAttributeNode(attr); // bypass setAttributeNode distortion
attr.value = 'import'; // attempt to set blocked value
document.head.appendChild(el); // append to head
```
### Distorted Behavior

The behavior varies according to the invoked distortion. If no distortions are registered for an attribute, the behavior seems native.
