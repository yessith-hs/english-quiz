## Element.prototype.before

The [`Element.prototype.before()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/before) method inserts a set of `Node` objects or `DOMString` objects before the `Element` in the child list of the parent of the `Element`. `DOMString` objects are inserted as equivalent `Text` nodes.

Lightning Web Security runs in the main window, where the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements are shared. Malicious code can add nodes or text before those shared elements, corrupting the DOM of the current rendered page.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion allows only a `<script>` or `<link>` element to be added after `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements. It throws an exception if any other element is specified.
