## Element.prototype.outerHTML setter

The [`Element.prototype.outerHTML`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/outerHTML)  property gets or sets the serialized HTML fragment describing the element including its descendants. It can also be set to replace the element with nodes parsed from the given string.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion sanitizes and prevents HTML from replacing the shared `<head>` and `<body>` elements.
