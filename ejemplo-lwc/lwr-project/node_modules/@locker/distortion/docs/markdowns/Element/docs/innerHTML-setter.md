## Element.prototype.innerHTML setter

The [`Element.prototype.innerHTML`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/innerHTML) property gets or sets the HTML or XML markup contained within the element.

You can set `Element.prototype.innerHTML` to replace DOM inside the element with nodes parsed from the given specified text as HTML.

This distortion sanitizes and prevents HTML from replacing the DOM within shared `<head>` and `<body>` elements.
