## Fullscreen API: Element.prototype

The [Fullscreen API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API) adds methods to present a specific `Element` (and its descendants) in full-screen mode, and to exit full-screen mode when it is no longer needed. This API makes it possible to present desired content such as an online game, using the user's entire screen. Full-screen mode removes all browser user interface elements and other applications from the screen until full-screen mode is shut off.

It is supported by all major browsers, with varying implementations.

This API doesn't adjust the DOM in the element. Instead, the native fullscreen hooks onto the browser. Malicious code can use the fullscreen API for phishing attacks. For example, because the fullscreen API obscures the browser's address bar, malicious code can hide the fake URL of a phishing page. Malicious coders can also fake an address bar with their own DOM.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion prevents code from requesting full screen by
blocking these properties from `Element.prototype` on specified browsers:

* `onfullscreenchange` [Chrome, Edge, Firefox]
* `onfullscreenerror` [Chrome, Edge, Firefox]
* `requestFullscreen` [Chrome, Edge, Firefox]
* `webkitRequestFullScreen` [Chrome, Edge, Safari]
* `webkitRequestFullscreen` [Chrome, Edge, Safari]
* `mozRequestFullScreen` [Firefox]
