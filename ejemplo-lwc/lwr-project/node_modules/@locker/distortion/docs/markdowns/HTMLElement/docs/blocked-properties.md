## HTMLElement.prototype.nonce

The [`HTMLElement.prototype.nonce`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/nonce) property returns an element's cryptographic nonce (number used once) that is used by Content Security Policy to determine whether a given fetch will be allowed to proceed.

Lightning Web Security doesn't allow the use of inline scripts even when a nonce is used. Malicious code with access to the `nonce` value can use it to bypass the Content Security Policy that determines whether a given script is allowed to proceed, and then run inline scripts.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion blocks access to `HTMLElement.prototype.nonce` in Chrome, Edge.
