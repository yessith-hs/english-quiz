## HTMLElement.prototype.onrejectionhandled and HTMLElement.prototype.onunhandledrejection [Safari]

The [`WindowEventHandlers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers) mixin describes the event handlers common to several interfaces like `Window`, or `HTMLBodyElement` and `HTMLFrameSetElement`. Each of these interfaces can implement additional specific event handlers.

The [`WindowEventHandlers.onrejectionhandled`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onrejectionhandled) property is an event handler representing the code to be called when the `rejectionhandled` event is raised, indicating that a Promise was rejected and the rejection has been handled. The event is sent to the script's global scope.

The [`WindowEventHandlers.onunhandledrejection`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onunhandledrejection) property is an event handler representing the code to be called when the `unhandledrejection` event is raised, indicating that a Promise was rejected but the rejection was not handled. The code handles the event that's sent to the script's global scope when a Promise is rejected, and there is no handler for the rejection.

While most events are DOM related, these event handlers receive an event object containing information about the rejected promise, including the `type`, `promise`, and `reason` properties. Malicious code that accesses the event handler properties can look into the promise info.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion blocks access to `HTMLElement.prototype.onrejectionhandled` and `HTMLElement.prototype.onunhandledrejection` in Safari.
