## HTMLElement.prototype.dataset getter

The [`HTMLElement.prototype.dataset`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dataset) read-only property of the HTMLElement interface provides read/write access to custom data attributes (`data-*`) on elements. It exposes a map of strings (`DOMStringMap`) with an entry for each `data-*` attribute.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion alters the getter of the `dataset` property for any `HTMLElement`. The `dataset` object is marked as live such that any properties changed from within the sandbox are reflected in the DOM.
