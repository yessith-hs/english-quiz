## HTMLElement.prototype.style getter

The [`HTMLElement.prototype.style`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/style) read-only property returns the inline style of an element in the form of a `CSSStyleDeclaration` object that contains a list of all styles properties for that element with values assigned for the attributes that are defined in the element's inline `style` attribute.

The `style` property of an `HTMLElement` object lets you manipulate CSS styles with JavaScript by using assignments. For example, you could change an element's text color using `element.style.color = 'red'`.

A property set on a `HTMLElement` object reflects in the DOM via the `style` attribute on an element.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion alters the getter of the `style` property of an `HTMLElement`. The `style` object is marked as live so that its native behavior is preserved and any properties changed from within the sandbox are also reflected in the DOM.
