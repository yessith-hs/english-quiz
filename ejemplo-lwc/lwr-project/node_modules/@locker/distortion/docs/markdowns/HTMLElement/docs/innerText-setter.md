## HTMLElement.prototype.innerText setter

The [`HTMLElement.prototype.innerText`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/innerText) property of represents the "rendered" text content of a node and its descendants. As a setter, it can be used to replace the rendered content of the element.

Lightning Web Security runs in the main window, where the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements are shared. Malicious code can replace the contents of those elements by assigning a new value to the `.innerText` property, corrupting the DOM of the current rendered page.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion sanitizes the given text and prevents it from replacing the text within the shared elements `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
