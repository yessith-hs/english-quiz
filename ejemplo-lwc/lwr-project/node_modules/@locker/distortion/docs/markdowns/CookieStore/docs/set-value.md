## CookieStore.prototype.set

The [`CookieStore.prototype.set()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieStore/set) method of the `CookieStore` interface sets a cookie with the given name and value or options object.

Distortion of `CookieStore.prototype.set` is required so `CookieStore.prototype.get` can retrieve sandbox cookies that are similarly distorted with the sandbox prefix.

This distortion also prevents malicious code from accessing system cookies that Salesforce uses to function. Otherwise any sandbox can send malicious payloads to the backend using cookies.

### Distorted Behavior

The `set()` method automatically adds the sandbox prefix to keys for sandbox cookies.
