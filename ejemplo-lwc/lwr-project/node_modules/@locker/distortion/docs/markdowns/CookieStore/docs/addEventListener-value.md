## CookieStore.prototype.addEventListener

The [`CookieStore.prototype.addEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) method of the `EventTarget` interface sets up a function that will be called whenever the specified event is delivered to the target.

Common targets are `Element`, or its children, `Document`, and `Window`, but the target may be any object that supports events (such as `XMLHttpRequest`).

This distortion prevents code from accessing cookies outside of the sandbox.

### Distorted Behavior

Lightning Web Security does not support the `change` event of `CookieStore` objects. Calls to `CookieStore.prototype.addEventListener()` for the `change` event throw an exception.
