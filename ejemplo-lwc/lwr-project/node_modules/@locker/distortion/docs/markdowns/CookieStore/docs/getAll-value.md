## CookieStore.prototype.getAll

The [`CookieStore.prototype.getAll()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieStore/getAll) method of the `CookieStore` interface returns a list of cookies that match the name or options passed to it. Passing no parameters will return all cookies for the current context.

If malicious code can access all cookies on a page, it can issue XHR requests impersonating the user who's logged in. This behavior can have catastrophic effects in a multi-tenant environment like Salesforce.

This distortion protects the value of `CookieStore.prototype.getAll` and limits the view to what is being retrieved from within the sandbox. Cookies in the sandbox are protected from code outside or in other sandboxes.

### Distorted Behavior

The `getAll()` method returns only sandbox cookies.
