## CookieStore.prototype.get

The [`CookieStore.prototype.get()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieStore/get) method of the `CookieStore` interface returns a single cookie with the given name or options object.

If malicious code can access any cookie on a page, it can issue XHR requests impersonating the user who's logged in. This behavior can have catastrophic effects in a multi-tenant environment like Salesforce.

This distortion protects the value of `CookieStore.prototype.get` and limits the view to what is being retrieved from within the sandbox. Cookies in the sandbox are protected from code outside or in other sandboxes.

### Distorted Behavior

The `get()` method returns only sandbox cookies.
