## CookieStore.prototype.delete

The [`CookieStore.prototype.delete()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieStore/delete) method of the `CookieStore` interface deletes a cookie with the given name or options object.

If malicious code deletes cookies on a page, it could remove login cookies and make the app unusable. This distortion protects cookies outside the sandbox from `CookieStore.prototype.delete` and limits what can be deleted within the sandbox. Cookies in the sandbox are protected from code outside or in other sandboxes.

### Distorted Behavior

The distortion only permits deletion of sandbox cookies.
