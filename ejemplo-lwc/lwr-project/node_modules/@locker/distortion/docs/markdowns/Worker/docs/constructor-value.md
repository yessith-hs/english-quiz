## Worker Constructor

The [`Worker()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/Worker) constructor creates a `Worker` object that executes the script at the specified URL. This script must obey the same-origin policy.

Malicious code can execute a script at a specified URL to bypass Lightning Web Security evaluation rules.

### Distorted Behavior

Lightning Web Security throws an exception `Lightning Web Security: Cannot create Worker with ${url}` when calling the constructor. Lightning Web Security blocks access to `Worker.prototype`.
