## History.prototype.replaceState

The [`History.prototype.replaceState()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/replaceState) method modifies the current history entry, replacing it with the state object and URL passed in the method parameters. This method is particularly useful when you want to update the state object or URL of the current history entry in response to some user action.

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion preserves the `replaceState()` method's native behavior in the sandbox by ensuring that the [structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm) works correctly on the `state` parameter.
