## SVGSetElement: `to` attribute

The [`to`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/To#set) attribute specifies the value for the attribute during the duration of the element.

When you set the SVG resource dynamically with the `to` attribute, the SVG resource isn't sanitized. Malicious code can bypass Lightning Web Security with an `<iframe>` or `<script>` element inside the SVG resource and run code outside of sandbox. 

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion sanitizes SVG files that are passed with the `to` attribute of the `<set>` element.
